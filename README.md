KatoroðŸŒŒ: Hypothetical Programming LanguageKatoro is an early-stage personal project exploring the concept of a programming language that combines flexibility, direct memory management, and optional safety features. Currently, Katoro exists as a hypothesis, with its syntax and functionality still in the conceptual phase. The compiler and full feature set are yet to be developed.Project StatusKatoro is in its infancy. At this point:There is no compiler yet.All features are hypothetical and in the planning stage.The syntax and design are continuously evolving based on new ideas.Key ConceptsMemory Management: Katoro aims to allow direct memory management, similar to C, with optional safety layers that developers can enable or disable at their discretion.Optional Safety: Developers can choose to enable features like garbage collection and memory safety checks, but these are off by default for maximum control.Static and Dynamic Typing: Katoro intends to support both static and dynamic typing, enabling flexible programming paradigms within the same language.
syntax examples:
import.add(standard.io):
import.add(low.os):
import.add(safe.memerror):

   Static @program {
   #apply.safe (
   int: x = 45
   Int* ptr = Poin*x 
   address.move(x) = new(c757646bc)
   )
}

Personal ProjectThis project is entirely personal. Iâ€™m currently not seeking any contributions or external input. If youâ€™re interested in Katoroâ€™s progress, feel free to watch the project for updates as it evolves.
LicenseCurrently, Katoro does not have an official license, as it is a personal project still in the conceptual phase. As the project progresses, a license may be added.
